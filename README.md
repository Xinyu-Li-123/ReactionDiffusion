# Simulation of a Reaction-Diffusion system

This is the project of the course: MATH-UA 395 Special Topics, Section 001: Modeling and Simulation in Science, Engineering, and Economics. It simulates the bi-molecular reaction `A + B <-> AB` as a reaction-diffusion system. The theoretical model is a variant of [Gray-Scott Model](https://itp.uni-frankfurt.de/~gros/StudentProjects/Projects_2020/projekt_schulz_kaefer/).
